# Python Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are typically organized into three main categories: **creational** patterns, **structural** patterns, and **behavioral** patterns.

## 1. Creational Patterns: 
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They include:

- `Factory Pattern`: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
- `Abstract Factory Pattern`: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- `Builder Pattern`: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- `Prototype Pattern`: Creates new objects by cloning an existing object, rather than creating a new instance from scratch.
- `Singleton Pattern`: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global point of access to it.

## 2. Structural Patterns: 
These patterns deal with object composition, focusing on the relationships between objects. They include:

- `Composite Pattern`: Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- `Adapter Pattern`: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
- `Bridge Pattern`: Separates an object's interface from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
- `Decorator Pattern`: Dynamically adds new behavior to an object by wrapping it in a decorator object.
- `Facade Pattern`: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it easier to use.
- `Flyweight Pattern`: Reduces the memory footprint of large numbers of similar objects by sharing the common state between them.
- `Proxy Pattern`: Acts as a placeholder for another object, controlling its creation and access.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns: 
These patterns deal with object communication, focusing on how objects interact and fulfill their responsibilities. They include:

- `Chain of Responsibility Pattern`: Allows you to chain objects together to handle a request, passing it down the chain until it is handled.
- `Strategy Pattern`: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- `Observer Pattern`: Allows objects to subscribe to and receive notifications about changes to another object's state.
- `Command Pattern`: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing it to be queued, logged, or undone.
- `Interpreter Pattern`: Defines a grammar for a language and an interpreter to parse and execute expressions in that language.
- `Iterator Pattern`: Provides a way to iterate over a collection of objects without exposing the underlying representation.
- `Template Method Pattern`: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to provide concrete implementations of certain steps.
- `Mediator Pattern`: Defines an object that encapsulates the way a set of objects interact, allowing them to communicate without knowing about each other.
- `Memento Pattern`: Allows you to capture and restore an object's internal state without exposing its implementation details.
- `State Pattern`: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- `Visitor Pattern`: Separates an algorithm from an object structure, allowing you to add new operations without modifying the objects themselves.

These are just a few examples of design patterns and their categories. It's important to choose the right pattern for the problem you're trying to solve, and to understand how each pattern works and when to use it.
