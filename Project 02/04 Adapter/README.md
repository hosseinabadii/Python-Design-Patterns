# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to convert the interface of an existing class into another interface that the client code expects. It allows two incompatible interfaces to work together without changing the source code of either interface.

The Adapter Pattern is typically used in situations where there is a need to use an existing class that does not match the interface that the client code expects. By creating an adapter class that implements the expected interface and delegates to the existing class, the client code can use the existing class without modification.

Some common scenarios where the Adapter Pattern might be used include:

1. When there is a need to use a third-party library or component that does not provide the interface required by the client code.
2. When there is a need to reuse an existing class that is not designed to work with the client code's interface.
3. When there is a need to decouple the client code from the implementation details of an existing class.

Overall, the Adapter Pattern is a useful tool for creating code that is more flexible, modular, and reusable. It can help to simplify the integration of different components and libraries, and can make it easier to refactor or maintain code over time.
