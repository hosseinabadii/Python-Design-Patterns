# Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It provides a way to encapsulate the object creation process and make it more flexible and reusable.

The Factory Pattern is typically used in situations where there is a need to create different types of objects that share a common interface or base class, but the exact class of object needed is not known until runtime. By using a factory method to create the objects, the details of object creation can be hidden from the client code, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Some common scenarios where the Factory Pattern might be used include:

1. When there is a need to create objects dynamically at runtime, based on some input or configuration data.
2. When there are multiple types of objects that need to be created, but the client code should not be responsible for choosing which type to create.
3. When there is a need to create objects that have complex initialization requirements, or that need to be created in a specific order.

Overall, the Factory Pattern is a powerful tool for creating flexible and extensible code that can adapt to changing requirements over time.
