# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It allows the algorithms to vary independently from clients that use them.

The key idea behind the Strategy Pattern is to define a family of algorithms that can be used interchangeably. Each algorithm is encapsulated in a separate class that implements a common interface. This allows the client code to use any of the algorithms interchangeably, without knowing or caring about the details of how they work.

The Strategy Pattern is often used in situations where you have a set of algorithms that can be used for a particular task. For example, you might have different algorithms for sorting data, searching data, or compressing data. By encapsulating each algorithm in a separate class, you can easily switch between them at runtime, or use different algorithms in different situations.

The Strategy Pattern consists of three main components:

1. The Context: This is the object that uses the algorithm. It maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the work to it.

2. The Strategy: This is the interface that defines the algorithm. It provides a common set of methods that all concrete strategies must implement.

3. The Concrete Strategy: This is the class that implements the algorithm. It provides a specific implementation of the algorithm defined by the Strategy interface.

When the Context object needs to perform a particular task, it delegates the work to the Concrete Strategy object. The Context object doesn't know or care which Concrete Strategy object is being used, as long as it implements the Strategy interface.

Overall, the Strategy Pattern promotes modularity, flexibility, and extensibility in your code. By encapsulating each algorithm in a separate class, you can easily switch between them, add new algorithms, or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of your code.
