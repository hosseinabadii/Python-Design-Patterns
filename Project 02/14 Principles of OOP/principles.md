## You can combine Functional and Object-Oriented programming.
## Make classes either data-oriented or behavior-oriented.
## Be careful with inheritance (Try to use for abstract classes - dependency inversion)
## Use dependency injection (Use composite)
## Don't abouse Python power features (dunder methods)
## Functions are **flow action** focused, While classes are **state** focused
## Think of a class as a **structure** or a **template** that defines the characteristics and methods of an object. 
## Objects represent the state of things and methods modify the state
