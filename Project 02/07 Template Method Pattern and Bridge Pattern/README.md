# Template Method Pattern and Bridge Pattern

## Template Method Pattern

The template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass and allows subclasses to provide implementations for certain steps, while keeping the overall structure of the algorithm intact.

## Bridge Pattern

The Bridge Pattern is a design pattern that separates the abstraction from its implementation, allowing each to vary independently and providing greater flexibility and code reuse.
