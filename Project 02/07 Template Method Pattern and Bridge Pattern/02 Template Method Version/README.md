# Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the basic steps of an algorithm in a superclass and allows subclasses to override some of the steps without changing the overall structure of the algorithm. 

The template method pattern is used when you have an algorithm that has several steps, but the exact implementation of each step may vary depending on the context. In this pattern, you define a template method in the superclass that calls several abstract methods, which are implemented by the subclasses. The template method provides the overall structure of the algorithm, while the abstract methods provide the specific implementations of the individual steps.

The template method pattern is often used in situations where you have several related algorithms that have a lot of common steps, but also have some variations in implementation. By using the template method pattern, you can avoid code duplication and keep the overall structure of the algorithms consistent while still allowing for flexibility in the implementation of each step.

In summary, the template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass and allows subclasses to provide implementations for certain steps, while keeping the overall structure of the algorithm intact.
