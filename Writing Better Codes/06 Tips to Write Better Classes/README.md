# The Ultimate Guide to Writing Classes in Python

## Tip #1: Keep your classes small

Keep your classes short. If you have a really large class you're going to lose overview pretty quickly.

## Tip #2: Make your classes easy to use

Think about whether they are more data focused or behavior focused use properties to make your classes easier to use.

## Tip #3: Use dependency injection

Inject dependencies instead of creating objects inside a class.

## Tip #4: Make sure a class is actually needed

Only use classes if you actually need to create multiple instances of a class otherwise in Python simply use a module with functions.

## Tip #5: Use encapsulation

If you have lower level data structures in your class make sure that they're encapsulated so that the outside doesn't need to know all of the implementation details.
